### Features Left to Implement

As mentioned previously, the first iteration of Red Roots Farm site is a simple three page website serving as initial introduction to Red Roots Farm. 
It's envisaged that the site will be expanded gradually over time (in short sprints) to cater for more features which are described below. 

- Blog posts from Tom and Claire

- Links to podcast/audio links featuring short meditations for relaxation, gardening and sustainability hints and tips. 

- Timetable of upcoming events and classes

- Online booking form for events

- Web shop for Red Roots merchandise. 


## Design choices

Certain design decisions were made to keep the website 'clean', simple and easy to navigate. 

- In keeping with the essence of Red Roots Farm, photos on the website show flowers, greenery, colour and vibrancy of nature. 

- Fonts chosen for the website were simple ones - Lato (For Headings) and Merriweather (For Body Text) as research indicated they pair well together and are "pleasant to read". 

- As an alternative to using pure white as background colour, the colour Snow (#FFFAFA) was used as research suggested this as a good alternative 
[PicMonkey](https://www.picmonkey.com/colors/white/off-white). 


## Testing 

Manual Testing 

- I tested that this website works in different browsers: Edge, Chrome and Safari. 
- I tested that this website is responsive, and displays correctly on standard screen sizes using the devtools device toolbar. 
- I confirmed that the navigation, header, about us, gallery and contact us text are legible and easy to understand. 
- I confirmed that the links throughout the site all work and go where they're meant to (Logo, Navigation Bar, Local Attraction website links to external, Social Media links in footer). 
- I confirmed that the form works as expected. Every field (Name, Email address, Question/Comment) has required field validator and also Email address field requires email address. Finally, the submit button works correctly. 


Solved Bugs 
- Logo on the Contact Us page didn't return back to index.html. Fixed as required by changing url. 
- Some of the images weren't loading correctly as initially I was hosting within the site but then moved to Cloudinary. Fixed as required by changing url. 
- Text Area on the Contact Us page wasn't resizing properly for smaller screens. Fixed as required by setting max-width: 100% in media query. 
- Home link was displaying as Active on the Gallery page Navigation Bar, when Gallery should be displaying as active. Fixed as required by settingclass="active" for Gallery. 
- Message input field on the Contact Us Page didn't have required field validator on it. Fixed as required by including 'required'. 
- Message input field wasn't getting the exact same settings applied as the Name and Email Address, so appeared visually inconsistent. Fixed as required by correcting css selectors. 
- Uisneach link in Local Attractions section wasn't pointing to correct website. Fixed as required by changing url.
